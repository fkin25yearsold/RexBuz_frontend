# Body Stream Error Debug Fixes

## üîç Issue Analysis
The error "TypeError: body stream already read" was still occurring even after implementing `safeJsonParse` because:

1. **Multiple concurrent requests** to the same endpoint
2. **Response body consumed before reaching safeJsonParse**
3. **Same response object being reused/shared**

## üõ†Ô∏è Debug Features Added

### 1. Enhanced safeJsonParse Function
- **Body consumption check**: Detects if `response.bodyUsed` is true
- **Response caching**: Caches parsed JSON on response object (`response._parsedJSON`)
- **Detailed logging**: Logs response status, URL, and consumption state
- **Stack trace capture**: Shows where multiple consumptions happen

### 2. Request Tracking System
- **Concurrent request detection**: Tracks active requests by method:URL
- **Request lifecycle logging**: Shows request start, completion, and cleanup
- **Conflict identification**: Warns when multiple requests to same endpoint overlap

### 3. Improved Error Messages
- **Context-rich errors**: Include response status, URL, and stack trace
- **Specific error types**: Different messages for server errors vs client errors
- **Debugging guidance**: Clear indication of what went wrong

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Response Caching
```javascript
// Cache parsed result to avoid re-parsing
parsedJSON = JSON.parse(textContent);
response._parsedJSON = parsedJSON;
return parsedJSON;
```

### Concurrent Request Detection
```javascript
const activeRequests = new Map();
const requestKey = `${method}:${url}`;

if (activeRequests.has(requestKey)) {
  console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Concurrent request detected");
}
```

### Body Consumption Check
```javascript
if (response.bodyUsed) {
  if (response._parsedJSON !== undefined) {
    return response._parsedJSON; // Use cached data
  }
  throw new Error("Response body already consumed");
}
```

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

### Debug Information
- Clear logging showing request lifecycle
- Warning when concurrent requests detected
- Stack traces showing where body consumption conflicts occur

### Error Resolution
- Graceful handling of already-consumed responses
- Cached data reuse when available
- Better error messages for debugging

### Performance
- Reduced redundant API calls
- Cached response data reuse
- Proper request cleanup

## üß™ Testing
The enhanced debugging will help identify:
1. **Which endpoints** are being called concurrently
2. **Where** response bodies are being consumed multiple times
3. **How often** the caching mechanism is being used

This should resolve the body stream errors and provide clear debugging information for any remaining issues.
